# AinaScan

Welcome!

This project comes out of respect for my local community and to the world of coffee growers big and small. With all of the farmers hard work an dedication we get to enjoy one of the most refreshing beverages in the world. To programmers like myself, we need it to survive.

AinaScan is a tool suite and application purpose built for researchers and farmers to understand yields, pests, deficiencies, and diseases of their crops. With out data collection tools, and suite of layered machine learning and deep learning models, anaylitics are presented to our users in a consumable fashion.

Some of the desired features of this tool:

- Collect and upload data effortlessly from a standard smart phone (IOS and Android support powered by React Native)
- Segment out various plots of land with an interactive web tool to segregate different fields, species, or rows.
- Record spraying, harvesting, pruning, and other manual maintenance activities
- Run complex AI powered anaylitics and gain insight into the dieases, pests, and deficencies present
- Data is presented at a high level for easy consumability to farmers, but deep insights for researchers are just a few clicks away
- Get recommended schedules for spraying, harvesting, and fertilizing.
- Crop independent! Although coffee is the primary objective, other models can be integrated for other types of crops.

For the interested developer and engineer:

- Completely cloud indepedent. All Kubernetes. Cloud-Native applications first
- Made to run on bare metal (our test environment is on bare metal)
